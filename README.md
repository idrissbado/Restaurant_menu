# Delicious Ivorian Menu Webpage

## Overview

For this assignment, I created a webpage for a fictional restaurant's menu, "Delicious Ivorian Menu." The goal was to display various menu items such as appetizers, main courses, and desserts using HTML and CSS. Additionally, the webpage was made responsive to ensure it looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.

### Features:
- **Title:** The webpage has a title that reflects the name of the restaurant: *Delicious Ivorian Menu*.
- **Menu Sections:** The webpage includes three main sections:
  - **Appetizers**
  - **Main Courses**
  - **Desserts**
- **Contact Link:** A placeholder contact link is provided at the bottom of the page.
